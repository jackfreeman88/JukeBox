# JukeBox


JukeBox is redefining the intersection between artist and listener. Streaming services account for the vast majority of listener-artist interaction. They exert their control through monthly rates. As users accumulate time and money invested in these services, they become increasingly dependent and reluctant to unsubscribe due to a price or policy change.
